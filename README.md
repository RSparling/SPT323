# What is this
This is an attempt to build an ECS Game Engine in Rust as a learning project for University. The intent was to create the core and foundation of a game engine to learn what a game engine needs, the limitations and benefits of Rust, and build up my personal portfolio for the future.

## Features
ECS System
Camera System with implementented ray cast rending
Level System
Rendering Manager
Input Handling

## Warning
For anyone looking for a Rust game engine, this is far more limited in scope and ability than many already out there. It is recommended that you look into Bevy or Rapier instead. This was made from scratch in rust by someone with limited time, knowledge, and ability to expand their skills. It may be good to look over and decide how you would like to handle your own but it is not something you should look to in order to produce a game with unless you seek to expand upon or learn from this project.
